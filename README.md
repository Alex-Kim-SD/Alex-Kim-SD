As a Full Stack Software Engineer with a background in finance and fintech, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge across a diverse range of development environments. In one of my notable projects, I utilized OpenAI's API to develop a unique, interactive web application that generates dialogue between AI personalities. This project showcased my proficiency managing and creating API, AI integration, and my deep understanding of OpenAI's GPT models.

I've also contributed to developing a feature-rich rental service platform, inspired by Airbnb. I have an extensive range of full-stack development skills, and commitment to improving user experiences.

Throughout these experiences, I've consistently shown my ability to create dynamic software solutions and apply technology effectively to enhance user experiences and solve complex problems.
